about heroku:
after installing heroku cli and login, and setting up the heroku remote: 

- in packageJSON: what heroku needs is only the build script, 
	which has to do two things: "react-scripts build && npm install".
- in the server js file: 

	if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
	  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, './build')));
	} else {
	  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, './public')));
	}

that just tells him where to look for the static content in both cases - dev and deploy.
- all paths depend of course on your folder structure.
- about the build script: im my case I have one package.json file. if you have more,
 you'll have to use prefix to specify where the react-scripts build and npm install
 is(npm install - for both server and client)
 
 thats the short version, and it works for me. everything else is based on that.
